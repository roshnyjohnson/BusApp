### Hosted Project Link


### Project Description
This project is a real-time bus tracking system that allows drivers to update their bus location using GPS and enables students to view live bus locations.

### The Problem statement
Students often struggle to know the real-time location of college buses, causing delays and missed rides. Traditional schedules and manual updates are slow and unreliable.
* To solve the problem of students not knowing real-time bus locations by providing a secure, GPS-based bus tracking system that updates live locations via Firebase for instant student access.

### The Solution
We developed a real-time bus tracking system where bus drivers can securely log in and update their bus location using their mobile devices. Students can access live bus locations instantly without logging in, ensuring a seamless and convenient tracking experience.
